## 📝 Overview  
This project implements a simple **rule-based sentiment analysis** algorithm using **Python**. It processes Amazon.com reviews for cell phones and accessories, analyzing sentiments based on predefined rules.  

## 🏆 Features  
- Loads and preprocesses JSON review data  
- Removes punctuation and stop words  
- Performs thematic analysis to identify key phrases  
- Implements a **rule-based sentiment analysis** method  
- Saves the analyzed results to a text file  

## 📂 Project Structure  
📦 Sentiment-Analysis  
┣ 📜 Code.ipynb # Jupyter Notebook with implementation  
┣ 📜 reviews.json # JSON file containing Amazon reviews  
┣ 📜 stopwords.txt # List of stop words for preprocessing  
┣ 📜 results.txt # Final sentiment analysis results  
┣ 📜 README.md # Project documentation  


## 🛠 Implementation Steps  

### 1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing
